# AavegotchiDAO Multisig-Signer-Election – Signal Proposal

**Date**: February 09, 2006

Frens, the discussion on the Nomination & Election of the Multi-Sig-Signers is entering the next stage:
- we were presented with ideas for advancing on our path to full-onchain Governance 
- we were made aware of the connections to the Constitution of our DAOs Foundation

With 9 nominees already signaling interest, we are ready to evolve the Multisig Signers structure once again from the original AGIP 50/51 setup (fixed 9 signers, 5/9 quorum, GHST pay). 

This Signal Proposal tests community sentiment on two key questions before a binding CoreProp. It is non-binding. 
[In case quorum is reached and it passes very strongly and discussions around the mentioned topics broaden, a Special Resolution to amend any or all of the Foundation Articles (13, 15, 17, 27, 56, 78) is not off the agenda. ]

**Fiduciary Reminder**  
Directors owe duties to the Foundation (Art. 24/26). We gauge security (decentralization vs. execution speed), treasury sustainability, and fairness in incentives.  



Signer-Election-Poll - Question 1: 
What is your preferred number of Signers for the next period?
(Single-choice - pick one)

Rationale: Original fixed 9. Flexibility allows adjustment based on nominees and needs (fewer = faster execution; more = stronger decentralization/security).

- Three (3), the Multi-Sig-Wallet executes with 2 out of 3 Signers
- Five (5), the Multi-Sig-Wallet executes with 3 out of 5 Signers
- Seven (7), the Multi-Sig-Wallet executes with 4 out of 7 Signers
- Nine (9), the Multi-Sig-Wallet executes with 5 out of 9 Signers 
- "Abstain / No preference"

Signer-Election-Poll - Question 2: 
What is your preferred quarterly USDC Compensation per Signer?
(Weighted Voting - spread your GHST power across options)

Rationale: Temporary switch to USDC until GHST stabilizes (past reference: ~2000 GHST quarterly ≈ 2000–2500 USDC). With the signer count chosen, scales show total spend. Allocate weight to express nuance with your GHST (e.g., 60% on 2000, 40% on 3000).

- 500 USDC (very conservative)  
- 1000 USDC (low but sustainable)  
- 2000 USDC (historical reference level – balanced)  
- 3000 USDC (attractive for commitment)  
- 5000 USDC (high to attract signers)  
- Abstain / No preference 

**Voting Details**  
- Duration: 5 days (quick signal)  
- Quorum: ~20% GHST (traditional SigProp level)  
- Strategy: GHST token-weighted  
- If strong support, this will produce data and lead to a fast follow-up CoreProp. [conceivably a Special Resolution (2/3 majority required for binding amendment).]  

Nominate (until 02-10-26, 8:30pm CET) and vote now! – the discussion is live in Discord! 
Let's move quickly while momentum is high!
