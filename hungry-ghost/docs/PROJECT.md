# Hungry GHost – Project notes

## Budget proposal

- Hungry GHost is **part of the upcoming budget proposal**.
- From the start: revenue clearly trackable and attributable to the DAO (wallet, categories, reporting).
- **Realtime monitoring showcase:** Hungry GHost serves as a showcase for realtime monitoring – live visibility of revenue and activity for the DAO.

## Revenue integration (planned)

- **Tracking:** Which revenue sources (e.g. sales, fees)? Which wallet/address?
- **Reporting:** Integration with Treasury Dashboard and/or Accounting App (shared addresses, categories like "Protocol Revenue", "NFT Sales" etc.).
- **Governance:** Maintain short description and expected revenue for the proposal in this folder.
