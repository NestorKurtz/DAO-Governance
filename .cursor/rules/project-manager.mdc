# Project Manager Rule

When the user asks for overview, connections, synergies, missing links, or next steps across projects:

1. **Reference the project map** – Use `.cursor/agents/project-manager.md` for the current project list and connections.
2. **Consider all projects** – accounting-app, treasury-dashboard, hungry-ghost, aavegotchi-foundation, aavegotchi-backend, contracts, and relevant skills (blockchain-data-scraper, dao-proposal-creator).
3. **Identify reuse** – Shared config (dao-addresses), categories, API endpoints, env vars.
4. **Suggest concrete next steps** – Prioritized, actionable, with hints on which project owns each step.
5. **Keep docs in sync** – When adding integrations, update READMEs and docs in the affected project folders.
