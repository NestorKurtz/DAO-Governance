## Context & Mission

### Background Resources

**Essential Reading:**
- [DAO Governance Oligarchy Discussion](https://dao.aavegotchi.com/t/dao-governance-oligarchy/927/16) - Community concerns about centralization
- [Aave Governance V2 Implementation](https://github.com/aave/governance-v2) - Technical precedent
- [Aavegotchi Contract Governance](https://docs.aavegotchi.com/developers/aavegotchi-contracts/extending-aavegotchi-contracts/governance) - Current system

### Mission Statement

The AavegotchiDAO documentation states:

> "It is our full intention to eventually transfer access to the diamondCut() function to the AavegotchiDAO. But this is a process of gradual decentralization. The DAO must be ready for this responsibility, or else the protocol will be at risk."

**This proposal treats this statement as the DAO's primary mission.** Every governance action should be evaluated against its contribution to achieving safe, complete decentralization.

### Rationale

**Current State:**
- Multi-Sig signers selected through informal processes
- Limited transparency in signer accountability
- No on-chain tracking of signer performance
- Community concerns about centralization

**Desired State:**
- Transparent, democratic signer selection
- On-chain accountability mechanisms
- Performance tracking and incentive alignment
- Progressive trust-building toward diamondCut() transfer

**Why Multi-Sig Signers Are Critical:**

The Multi-Sig signers are not merely fund managers. They represent:
1. **Current Role:** Guardians of treasury funds and protocol upgrades
2. **Future Role:** Final human checkpoint before irreversible protocol changes
3. **Security Node:** Last line of defense against malicious proposals
4. **Trust Bridge:** Community representatives in high-stakes decisions

**This makes signer selection a security-critical governance action** warranting the 20% quorum threshold, even though no protocol code is directly modified.

---

## Voting Mechanisms

### Off-Chain Vote (Primary Decision)

**Platform:** Snapshot  
**Type:** Weighted voting  
**Quorum:** 20%  
**Duration:** 7 days (standard)

**Rationale for 20% Quorum:**
- Security-critical decision
- Affects protocol trust and safety
- Establishes precedent for governance processes
- High community engagement required

**Voting Weight:** Based on GHST token holdings and vesting positions

### On-Chain Vote (Experimental)

**Platform:** Custom smart contract  
**Type:** Weighted voting  
**Quorum:** 0% (experimental, non-binding)  
**Duration:** Parallel to Snapshot vote

**Purpose:**
- Test on-chain governance infrastructure
- Gather data on gas costs and participation
- Build confidence in future on-chain systems
- Educational for community

**Important:** The on-chain vote is advisory only. The Snapshot result is binding.

---

## Phase I: Nomination & Role Definition

**Total Duration:** 144 hours (6 days)  
**Structure:** Two sequential 72-hour periods

### Part A: Candidate Nomination (72 hours)

**Objective:** Create a transparent pool of willing and qualified candidates

#### Nomination Process

**Who Can Nominate:**
- Any wallet with voting power in the DAO
- Minimum: 100 GHST (prevents spam)

**Who Can Be Nominated:**
- Any community member
- Self-nomination encouraged
- No minimum GHST holding for candidates (trust-based)

**How to Nominate:**

**Option 1 - On-Chain (Preferred):**
```
1. Connect wallet to governance portal
2. Navigate to "Multi-Sig Nomination"
3. Enter candidate wallet address
4. Add 280-character statement
5. Submit transaction (minimal gas)
```

**Option 2 - Discord (Temporary):**
```
1. Post in #multi-sig-nominations channel
2. Format: @candidate wallet_address "statement"
3. React with 👍 to signal nomination
4. Will be manually added to on-chain record
```

**Nomination Requirements:**

Candidates must provide:
1. **Wallet Address:** For on-chain tracking
2. **Contact Info:** Discord/Telegram for availability signaling
3. **Statement (280 chars):** Why they want to serve
4. **Hardware Wallet Commitment:** Own or will acquire unused device
5. **Availability Commitment:** 
   - Response within 24h for urgent signatures
   - Response within 48h for standard signatures
   - Proactive signaling of unavailability (vacation, etc.)

**Transparency:**
- All nominations publicly visible on-chain
- Nomination timestamps recorded
- Can nominate multiple candidates
- Can withdraw nomination if candidate declines

#### Expected Outcomes

- **Target:** 8-15 candidates
- **Minimum:** 5 candidates (proposal fails if not reached)
- **Maximum:** No limit (community self-regulates)

---

### Part B: Role Definition & Assessment (72 hours)

**Objective:** Community-driven definition of role requirements and candidate evaluation

This phase introduces an experimental on-chain assessment system while maintaining established governance standards.

#### Component 1: Traditional Requirements (Reaffirmed)

These requirements remain mandatory from previous signer selections:

**1. Community Standing:**
- Active DAO participant for minimum 6 months
- No history of governance attacks or malicious proposals
- Positive reputation in Discord/Forum
- Verification: Snapshot vote history + Discord role

**2. Technical Requirements:**
- Own unused hardware wallet (Ledger/Trezor) OR
- Commitment to acquire within 7 days if elected
- Basic understanding of Multi-Sig operations
- Able to verify transaction details before signing

**3. Commitment Requirements:**
- Available for urgent signatures (24h response)
- Available for standard signatures (48h response)
- Proactive communication of unavailability
- Minimum 1-year commitment (or as voted)

#### Component 2: New Accountability Mechanisms

**Mandatory Availability Signaling:**

Signers must maintain an on-chain availability status:
- ✅ Available (default)
- ⏸️ Limited Availability (slow response expected)
- ❌ Unavailable (planned absence)

**How It Works:**
1. Signer updates status via simple transaction
2. Status visible on public dashboard
3. Alerts triggered if status unchanged for 30 days
4. Automatic alerts to remaining signers if any signer marks unavailable

**Penalties for Non-Signaling:**

Vote on ONE penalty mechanism from these options:

**Option A: Performance Badge System**
- Earn badges for consistent availability/signing
- Lose badge tier for missed signals
- Badges affect future signer elections (reputation)

**Option B: Reputation Coin Adjustment**
- Hypothetical "REP" token allocation
- Increase for good performance
- Decrease for missed signals
- Could affect future governance weight

**Option C: Reliability Ranking**
- Simple on-chain score (0-100)
- Calculated from: response time, availability updates, successful signatures
- Public dashboard showing all signers
- No direct penalty, but transparent performance tracking

**Option D: Competitive Bounty Model**
- Fixed bounty per successful signature (e.g., $50 USDC)
- Distributed to signers who complete signature
- Missed signatures = missed bounty (opportunity cost)
- Incentivizes fast response

**Option E: Hybrid Approach**
- Combine ranking (transparency) + bounty (incentive)
- Community votes on specific parameters

**Voting Method:** Ranked choice (1st, 2nd, 3rd preference)

#### Component 3: Community Assessment (EXPERIMENTAL)

**This is the most innovative part of the proposal.**

**Objective:** Gather anonymous, quantitative community input on candidate suitability

**How It Works:**

Each voter receives **100 ValuePoints** to distribute among candidates across 4 traits:

**The 4 Traits:**

1. **Technical Competence (0-100 points)**
   - Understanding of protocol mechanics
   - Ability to verify transaction safety
   - Technical problem-solving skills

2. **Reliability & Commitment (0-100 points)**
   - Track record of follow-through
   - Consistent community engagement
   - Perceived dedication to role

3. **Communication & Transparency (0-100 points)**
   - Clear communication style
   - Responsive to questions
   - Proactive information sharing

4. **Alignment with DAO Values (0-100 points)**
   - Long-term thinking vs. short-term gains
   - Community-first mindset
   - Governance participation history

**Allocation Rules:**
- Total must equal 100 points per candidate assessed
- Minimum allocation: 5 points per trait (prevents spam)
- Can assess multiple candidates (100 points per candidate)
- Cannot assess yourself (if you're a candidate)

**Optional Text Feedback:**
- 69-character limit (Discord-style brevity)
- Anonymous (wallet address not linked)
- Displayed alongside quantitative scores

**Example Assessment:**

```
Candidate: Alice (0x1234...5678)

Technical Competence:        ⬛⬛⬛⬛⬛⬛⬛⬛⬜⬜ 40 pts
Reliability & Commitment:    ⬛⬛⬛⬛⬛⬜⬜⬜⬜⬜ 25 pts
Communication & Transparency: ⬛⬛⬛⬜⬜⬜⬜⬜⬜⬜ 15 pts
DAO Values Alignment:        ⬛⬛⬛⬛⬛⬛⬛⬛⬛⬛ 20 pts

Feedback: "Strong technical skills, but could engage more in forums"
```

**Aggregation:**
- Median score per trait (resistant to outliers)
- Total score = sum of median trait scores
- Displayed on public leaderboard
- Used as advisory input (not binding requirement)

**Privacy:**
- Individual assessments are private
- Only aggregated results published
- Prevents targeted retaliation
- Encourages honest feedback

#### Component 4: Compensation Framework

**Current Precedent:** Multi-Sig signers historically received USDC compensation

**Voter Input Required:**

**1. Term Length:**

Vote on preferred signer term:
- [ ] 6 months (high rotation, fresh perspectives)
- [ ] 1 year (current standard, balanced)
- [ ] 18 months (more stability, less elections)
- [ ] 2 years (maximum stability)
- [ ] Other: _________ (write-in)

**Voting Method:** Ranked choice

**2. Compensation Amount:**

Select up to 3 preferred values between $200 - $3,000 USDC:

```
$200  $300  $400  $500  $600  $700  $800  $900
$1,000 $1,100 $1,200 ... $2,900 $3,000
```

**Selection is per term (not monthly)**

**Example Voter Selection:**
- 1st choice: $1,500
- 2nd choice: $1,200  
- 3rd choice: $1,800

**Calculation:** Median of all voters' median choices becomes the compensation

**Rationale for Range:**
- $200 minimum (symbolic, covers gas costs)
- $3,000 maximum (meaningful but not excessive)
- Community decides appropriate value
- Adjustable in future elections

**3. Payment Method:**

Vote on structure:
- [ ] Lump sum at end of term
- [ ] Quarterly payments
- [ ] Performance-based (e.g., per signature)
- [ ] Hybrid (base + performance bonus)

---

## Phase II: Signal Proposal

**Duration:** TBD (voted in Phase I)  
**Platform:** Snapshot  
**Quorum:** 20%

### Timeline Options (Voted in Phase I.B)

**Option A: Simultaneous Start**
- Signal proposal starts with nominations
- Runs parallel to entire Phase I (144h)
- Fastest path to decision
- Risk: Less informed voting early

**Option B: Post-Nomination Start**
- Signal starts after nominations close
- Voters see candidate pool first
- 72h for candidate review + 7d voting = 9-10 days total

**Option C: Post-Role-Definition Start**
- Signal starts after entire Phase I completes
- Most informed voting
- 144h Phase I + 7d Signal = 13-14 days total
- Recommended option

**Option D: Delayed Start**
- Additional review period after Phase I
- Start date announced during Phase I
- Maximum deliberation time
- Could extend to 18-21 days total

**Community will vote on this during Phase I.B**

### Content of Signal Proposal

**Automatically Incorporated from Phase I:**

1. **Final Candidate List**
   - Names, wallet addresses, statements
   - Nomination timestamps
   - Community assessment scores (if available)

2. **Role Definition Results**
   - Chosen penalty mechanism for non-signaling
   - Determined term length
   - Agreed compensation amount
   - Availability requirements

3. **Process Improvements**
   - Any suggested changes from Phase I discussion
   - Technical refinements
   - Timeline adjustments

**Manual Addition:**
- Phase I on-chain data extracted and formatted
- Added to Snapshot proposal text
- Verified by multiple community members

**Vote Structure:**

```
For: Approve full proposal as specified
Against: Reject and return to discussion
Abstain: Counted toward quorum, neutral
```

### Quorum Thresholds Referenced

**For Context (not voted in this proposal):**

AavegotchiDAO typically uses:
- **5% quorum:** Minor decisions (parameter tweaks)
- **10% quorum:** Medium changes (new features)
- **20% quorum:** Major changes (protocol alterations)

**This proposal uses 20%** as signer selection is security-critical.

### Future Vision: Automated Signal→Core Transition

**Not implemented yet, but planned:**

Eventually, successful Signal proposals will automatically:
1. Trigger smart contract to create Core Proposal
2. Transfer all data on-chain
3. Start Core Proposal voting period
4. Execute if Core Proposal passes

**Benefits:**
- Eliminates manual data transfer
- Reduces human error
- Faster governance cycle
- More trustless process

---

## Phase III: Core Proposal

**Duration:** 11-18 days (depends on Phase II timing)  
**Deadline:** February 28, 2026  
**Platform:** On-chain (AavegotchiDAO contracts)

### Core Proposal Voting

**Standard Path:**

```
Signal passes (≥20% quorum) 
→ Core Proposal created
→ 7-day voting period
→ If passes: Execute proposal
→ If fails: Return to discussion
```

**Experimental Path (New Feature):**

```
Signal passes with REDUCED quorum (10-19%)
→ Core Proposal created
→ 7-day voting period  
→ If passes: Enter VETO PERIOD (Phase IV)
→ If fails: Return to discussion
```

**Rationale for Veto Period:**

For proposals with partial community support:
- Allows time for opposition to mobilize
- Community can veto if strong objection emerges
- Balances efficiency with safety
- Tests new governance primitive

### Execution Details

**If Core Proposal Passes:**

1. **Elected Signers Announced**
   - Public announcement on all channels
   - Wallet addresses published
   - Term start date confirmed

2. **Onboarding Process**
   - Hardware wallet verification
   - Multi-Sig wallet access granted
   - Discord/Telegram contact confirmed
   - Availability signaling system activated

3. **Term Begins**
   - Official start date (e.g., March 1)
   - First compensation payment scheduled
   - Performance tracking initiated
   - Old signers transition out (if applicable)

4. **Ongoing Monitoring**
   - Public dashboard shows signer activity
   - Monthly community reports
   - Quarterly performance reviews

**If Core Proposal Fails:**

- Return to community discussion
- Identify failure reasons
- Option to create modified proposal
- Phase I can be reopened if needed

## Technical Implementation

### Smart Contracts Required

**1. Nomination Contract**
- `nominate(address candidate, string statement)`
- `withdrawNomination(uint256 nominationId)`
- `getNominations() returns (Nomination[])`

**2. Assessment Contract**  
- `assessCandidate(address candidate, uint8[4] traitScores, string feedback)`
- `getAggregatedScores(address candidate) returns (uint8[4])`

**3. Availability Signaling Contract**
- `updateStatus(Status newStatus)`
- `getSignerStatus(address signer) returns (Status)`
- `getActiveSigners() returns (address[])`

**4. Performance Tracking Contract**
- `recordSignature(address signer, uint256 timestamp)`
- `calculateReliabilityScore(address signer) returns (uint8)`

### Gas Cost Estimates

**Per-Action Costs (Base Sepolia estimates):**
- Nominate candidate: ~50,000 gas (~$0.10)
- Assess candidate: ~80,000 gas (~$0.15)
- Update availability: ~30,000 gas (~$0.05)
- Record signature: ~40,000 gas (~$0.08)

**Total Voter Cost (full participation):**
- 1 nomination + 5 assessments = ~450,000 gas (~$0.85)

### Data Storage

**On-Chain:**
- Candidate nominations
- Assessment scores (aggregated only)
- Signer availability status
- Signature records

**Off-Chain (IPFS):**
- Detailed candidate statements (>280 chars)
- Community feedback text
- Historical performance data
- Proposal discussion archives
